# Setup

The files in this folder are a custom card I'm building for HomeAssistant.
The HomeAssistant installation is in a separate minipc, running HomeAssistant on a Docker container.
Follow best practices to help me create the Custom Card so I can use it on my custom HomeAssistant setup, that includes giving me guidance and giving best practices for how to move, bundle and organize files in this directory so I can place them on the HomeAssistant container for use.

# Connections

My minipc with HA is located at minipc.local
The config directory is located at /home/lopermo/homeassistant/ (that corresponds with the /config mounted volume)
